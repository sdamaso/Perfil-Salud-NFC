# Perfil-Salud-NFC
Perfil Salud will allow users to have the medical information they enter the system recorded and quickly accessible from their device. In addition, they will not only be able to have their own information, but they will also be able to enter data on people close to them, such as their family. As a system for someone to be able to read the medical data of a person they do not know, it will be enough to scan the NFC card they are carrying.
